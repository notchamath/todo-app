# [To-Do Web App](https://chamathcodes.com/todo-app/)

<img src="/port3.jpg">

## The Idea
A `Fully Responsive` To-Do Web Application that incorporates `Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller Pattern` on the backend. Each To-Do Task is saved to the Browser using `JSON` and `localStorage API`. The implementation only uses HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. Original idea inspired by Supersimple.dev [JavaScript Course](https://supersimple.dev/courses/javascript-beginner-course-20201) but improved upon and a `User Interface` was added as well as `Input Validations`.
